# MediRoutine

**Executive Summary**
Problem: Medical instructions provided by doctors, especially for patients with chronic conditions or complex treatment plans, can be confusing, jargon-filled, and difficult to follow. This leads to poor adherence, medical errors, and increased stress for patients and their caregivers.

Solution: MediRoutine AI is a web-based application designed to solve this problem. Users will input their doctor's instructions (e.g., by typing or copy-pasting text), and the application will use Artificial Intelligence to parse, simplify, and organize this information into a clear, actionable daily schedule. The schedule will explicitly state what to do (medication, exercise), what to eat (dietary guidelines), and when to do it, complete with reminders.
Vision: To empower patients to take control of their health by transforming complex medical advice into a simple, manageable daily routine, thereby improving treatment adherence and health outcomes.
